SIMPLE ICON PLACEHOLDER (ASCII ART)

For now, you can use any simple icon. Here's a quick way to create one:

1. Use a simple geometric design:
   - Circle in center
   - 4 smaller circles in corners
   - Lines connecting center to corners

2. Or use a simple text-based icon:
   - "NPM" in a circle
   - "ðŸ“¦" emoji
   - "ðŸ”—" emoji (for dependencies)

3. Quick online tools:
   - favicon.io (creates icons from text/emoji)
   - canva.com (free icon creation)
   - flaticon.com (free icon downloads)

4. Simple design elements:
   - Background: Dark blue or transparent
   - Foreground: White or light colors
   - Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

The icon should be:
- 128x128 pixels
- PNG format
- Clear and recognizable
- Professional looking
- Work in both light and dark themes

Once you have the PNG icon, place it in the root directory as "icon.png" and the extension will use it.
